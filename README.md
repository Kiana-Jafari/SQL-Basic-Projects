This SQL Projects repository is designed to showcase various projects that focus on SQL skills development. Each project emphasizes different aspects of SQL, including querying databases, joining tables, aggregating data, and manipulating datasets to derive meaningful insights.

The structure of the repository is organized, with each project having its own dedicated folder. Inside these folders, you'll find:

1. **SQL Files**: The main scripts that contain the SQL queries used for each project. These files demonstrate how to perform various tasks and operations on the provided datasets.

2. **Data Files**: Each project includes relevant datasets that can be accessed and downloaded. These data files are essential for running the SQL queries and understanding the context of the projects.

3. **Documentation**: Many folders may also contain README files or other comments that outline the objectives of the project, the SQL concepts being practiced, and any specific problem statements addressed within the project.

The projects serve as both practice exercises and a portfolio to showcase your SQL expertise.
