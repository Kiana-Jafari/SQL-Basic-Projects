# Basic SQL Projects

Welcome to my **Basic SQL Projects** repository!
This repository contains a collection of SQL projects, primarily completed through **DataCamp** to practice querying, joining, and aggregating data.  

> **Note:** For security, privacy, and dignity purposes of DataCamp, the datasets used in these projects are **not included**. Only SQL queries, a frame of result-set, and solutions are provided.

These projects serve as a personal learning archive and showcase of SQL fundamentals.
